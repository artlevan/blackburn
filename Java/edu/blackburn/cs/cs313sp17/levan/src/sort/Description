We will create fixed arrays with sizes: 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 125000, 250000, 500000, 625000, and 1000000. 
We will then fill each array with integers from sizes 0 to 1,000,000. This will allow us a broad range of results 
regarding how each sorting algorithm handles various-sized inputs, allowing us to create a more in-depth analysis of the algorithms.

We will then pass in each array to each sorting method, after modifying the code to keep track of swaps and comparisons
with class-level variables, as well as another variable that will measure the runtime of each algorithm. (System time.)
With this implementation, we should hopefully see clearly the differences in performance between each sorting algorithm 
in respect to various sized inputs.
